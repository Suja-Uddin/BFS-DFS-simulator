# BFS DFS Simulator 

This work is done as a part of undergraduate assignment.

BFS and DFS algorithm simulation is devoped using Visual C++ and iGraphics(a graphics library developed using OpenGL).

One can draw nodes and edges between them. Then two nodes are selected to run the simulation of either BFS or DFS. Each node is colored distinctly to better understand the simulation.
